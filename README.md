Deleting , Swapping, Merging, 2D array

1.Write a function called MINIMUM which takes pointer to first node in a non-empty single
linked list of integers, finds and returns the address of a node with minimum key value.

2. Write a function called INSERT(PF, K) where PF is a pointer to first node in a non-empty single
linked list of integers and K is an integer , inserts a new node to the immediate left of the Kth
node and returns the updated list.

3. Write a function called INSERT(PF, K) where PF is a pointer to first node in a non-empty single
linked list of integers and K is an integer , inserts a new node to the immediate right of the Kth
node and returns the updated list.

4. Write a function called DELETE which takes pointer to first node in a non-empty single linked
list of integers, deletes all node whose keys are negative and returns the updated list.

5. Write a function called DELETE which takes pointer to first node in a non-empty single linked
list of integers, deletes the node following a node with a negative key and returns the
updated list.

6. Write a function called DELETE which takes pointer to first node in a non-empty single linked
list of integers, deletes the node immediately preceding a node with a negative key and
returns the updated list.

7. Write a function called APPEND which takes pointers to first node of two non-empty single
linked lists of integers, appends the second list to the end of first list and returns the updated
list.

8. Write a function called DESTROY which takes pointer to first node in a non-empty single
linked list of integers, destroys all the nodes and returns the updated list.

9. Write a function called SWAP(N1,N2) where N1 and N2 are pointers to two different nodes
in a non-empty(with more than 1 nodes) single linked list of integers, swaps N1 and N2
without creating temporary nodes and returns the updated list.(Note: node N2 comes after
N1).

10. Write a program to create a two dimensional array of integers using single linked list. The
node in the first column contains only two pointers as shown in Fig10.1. The left pointer points
to the next row. The right pointer points to the data in the row.

11. Write a function called INSERT(PH, K) where PH is a pointer to Header node in a non-empty
circular double linked list of integers with Header and K is an integer , inserts a new node as a
predecessor of the Kth node.

12. Write a function called DELETE(PH, K) where PH is a pointer to Header node in a non-empty
circular double linked list of integers with Header and K is an integer , deletes predecessor of
the Kth node(if it is not Header).

13. Write a function called DELETE(PH, K) where PH is a pointer to Header node in a non-empty
circular double linked list of integers with Header and K is an integer , deletes successor of
the Kth node(if it is not Header).

14. Write a function called REMOVEINSERT(PH) where PH is a pointer to Header node in a non-
empty circular double linked list of integers with Header , removes the last node and inserts
to the beginning of the list.

15. Write a function called SWAP(N1,N2) where N1 and N2 are pointers to two different nodes
in a non-empty(with more than 1 nodes) circular double linked list of integers with Header ,
swaps N1 and N2 without creating temporary nodes .

16. Write a function called MERGE which merges two sorted lists in to a single sorted list(Single
or Double)

17. Design a menu driven program to perform the following with linked list storage structures
i) Create (Read)a polynomial
ii) Display a polynomial
iii) Evaluate a polynomial
iv) Add two polynomials

18. Design a menu driven program to perform the following with linked list storage structures
i) Create (Read)a Long positive integer
ii) Display Long positive integer
iii) Add two Long positive integers

19. A university consists of 500 students and there are totally 40 courses for registration. Each
student can register maximum of 4 courses. Store the details of registration and generate
course wise registration and student wise registration details with linked storage structure.
